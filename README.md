# Project_CS306
Simple Hospital Database

This project contains:
 1. - Detailed description of database (requirements of enterpreice)
 2. - ER/EER diagram - Chen model
 3. - Relational scheme
 4. - MySQL database, exported .sql file. Screenshots of all physical tables.

I used great online software for drawing graphs, diagrams, schemes etc. called www.edrawmax.com. You need to sign in and you are free to use it, but you can not export that file if you do not have licence. Also I have used "wampserver64" for making my database. It is also free to use and you can export your whole database.
